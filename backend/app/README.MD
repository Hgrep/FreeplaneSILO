Created app/main.py with FastAPI app.

Wired routers for:

health

mindmaps

tags (empty for now)

Added health endpoint:

GET /api/v1/health

Returns {"status": "ok"}

Python environment with:
fastapi
uvicorn
sqlalchemy
python-multipart
lxml

Created app/db/base.py → defines Base = declarative_base()

Created app/db/session.py → defines SessionLocal and engine

Created initial Mindmap model (id, title, xml_content)

models/__init__.py exists

Created POST /api/v1/mindmaps/ endpoint

Checks for .mm file type

Will store raw XML

Calls a Freeplane parser (freeplane_parser.py) to parse XML into an internal tree

Parser:

Reads <map> root

Recursively reads <node> elements

Returns a dictionary: {"title": ..., "root": {...}}

Swagger UI shows endpoint with file upload ready

Swagger UI available at http://localhost:8000/docs


File upload shows as POST /api/v1/mindmaps/

Schemas are auto-generated by FastAPI

Currently, frontend integration is not yet done

What works now:
FastAPI app boots without errors

Routers and DB imports are resolved

Swagger UI loads

Freeplane parser code exists and is callable

Backend ready to accept .mm uploads (body validation shows in Swagger)

Next steps:
Create DB tables

Simple dev approach:

from app.db.base import Base
from app.db.session import engine
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)


Optional: add Alembic migrations later

Test file upload

Use Swagger /api/v1/mindmaps/

Upload a .mm file

Backend stores XML and parses it

Returns JSON tree of the mindmap

Return mindmap session

Add GET /api/v1/mindmaps/{id}/session

Returns parsed tree to frontend

Frontend integration

Create upload form

Display parsed tree recursively

Allow downloading .mm again

Optional extras (later)

Tags & metadata per mindmap or per node

Keyword extraction using spaCy

Dockerize backend/frontend, deploy to ECS/EKS

Kubernetes + Terraform infra

[currently I have a working fastAPI backend that can accept .mm file uploads, parse them, and return a JSON tree. The next steps involve creating the database tables, testing the file upload functionality, and integrating with the frontend to display the parsed mindmap.]
